            Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and
            maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals,
            dams, and buildings.<br><br>
            Civil engineering is considered a pioneer subject in the field of engineering. Civil Engineers—in one form
            or another—have been around ever since humans started building major public structures such as roads,
            bridges, tunnels and large public buildings. The discipline includes the planning, design, construction,
            maintenance and operation of infrastructures that surround us, and which underpin our society. Civil
            engineering branches into environmental engineering, Geo technical engineering, structural engineering,
            transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering,
            water resource engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying and construction
            engineering, among others.

            Computer engineering blends together computer science and electrical engineering to further advancements in
            digital technology, computer networking and computer systems. In turn, computer engineers use their
            extensive knowledge of hardware and software design and computer programming to make computing platforms and
            applications more efficient and effective. Seamlessly integrating the latest innovations, computer engineers
            develop new computer hardware, design and implement software applications, and enhance the capabilities of
            networks and communications systems.

            Students who wish to pursue a career in this field must have a strong background and understanding of
            mathematics and science. If a student excels in these subjects, computer engineering will most likely be a
            comfortable fit for them. Computer engineers must also possess strong detail orientation, teamwork, and
            analytical skills. Good communication skills are also needed, because computer engineers often need to go
            outside the lab to deal with customers, and other professionals.
