   <div class="about-diploma">
      A diploma is a certificate 
      that signifies a certain level of education
       and practical experience. Unlike a degree, diplomas are typically more s
       pecific regarding a certain career, take less time to achieve and provide more
        vocational experience. Before enrolling in a university course, it's helpful to 
        research diploma courses to see if this is a better option for you and your career plans. 
        In this article, we explain what a diploma is, the types of diplomas you can pursue and the 
        different jobs you can apply for with a diploma.

<span>What is a diploma?</span>
   <div class="defination-diploma">
      The answer to the question 'what is a diploma?' is that it's a certificate that 
      further education (FE) colleges issue when students complete a course and pass examinations. It takes between two and four years to achieve a diploma, depending on whether you study full-time or part-time. Earning a diploma requires a large amount of vocational and technical studies in a particular field. Diploma programmes offer field-specific courses and provide knowledge that is extremely useful for pursuing your career goals. 
      Having a diploma can be useful when entering a new job as it gives you real-world insight and experience.

   <span style="padding-top:2rem;">How is a diploma different from a degree?</span>
      <div class="defination-diploma">
         Both diplomas and degrees signify the completion of a level of study within a specific field. Further education institutions award diplomas to people who earn a grade of pass, merit or distinction. Universities award degrees to students who study a specific subject. The most common form of degree is a bachelor's degree, which takes between three to five years to complete. When students complete their degree studies, they can receive a first-class honours degree, also known as
          a 1st, a second-class honours degree, also known as a 2:1 and 2:2 or a third-class honours degree, also known as a 3rd.<br><br>

          The major difference between a diploma and a degree is the type of knowledge you receive from these courses. To receive a degree, you study one subject in-depth for several years, attending lectures at university to learn everything you can about this subject. A diploma involves much more vocational and hands-on experience. Some students studying for a diploma don't attend class at all and can instead complete all diploma exercises and studies 
          online. Studying for a diploma offers more real-world experience while studying for a 
          degree involves more theoretical knowledge.

   <div class="diploma-level">
      <span style="padding-top:2rem;">What are the different levels of a diploma?</span>
         <div class="defination-diploma">
            There are many levels of diplomas that you can achieve. Some diplomas are equivalent to a degree.
             Here are the most common types of diplomas and what they include:<br><br>
            <span style="padding-top:2rem;font-size: 28px;font-weight: bold;color:rgb(32, 30, 30);">Level 3 National Diploma</span>
            <div style="margin-top:1rem;">
               A Level 3 National Diploma is equivalent to an A-level. People also call this a BTEC Level 3 qualification. 
               BTEC stands for Business Technology and Education Council, which was the institution that first awarded these qualifications. Now many further education 
               institutions offer these courses which focus on giving students vocational knowledge regarding a specific subject.<br><br><br>
               While a Level 3 National Diploma is equivalent to two A-levels, unlike A-levels, there is no final exam to study for. Instead, you can expect people to monitor and assess you throughout the course and award marks towards your final grade. To achieve a Level 3 National Diploma, you can attend classes and complete several work placements
               . After two years of study, students receive a Level 3 National Diploma, also known as a BTEC Extended Diploma.

            <div style="padding-top:2rem;font-size: 28px;font-weight: bold;color:rgb(32, 30, 30);">Diploma of Higher Education</div>
            <div style="margin-top:1rem;">
               A Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE) is like an HND but with more of a 
               focus on academics instead of vocational assessments. It's the academic equivalent to an HND, 
               meaning that receiving a DipHE is also equal to two years of full-time study at a university. 
               A DipHE is an excellent option for students who cannot commit to a three or four-year degree. 
               While both a DipHE and an HND have some focus on vocational aspects, furthering education institutions
                asses Diplomas of Higher Education in more traditional ways such as academic essays and final exams.
